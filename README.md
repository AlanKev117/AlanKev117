### Hi there üëã

You've stumbled upon mi GitHub profile, let me give you a little background of who I am and what I do over here. 

I am a graduated Computer Systems Engineering student from Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional at Escuela Superior de C√≥mputo. I have had the privilege of working for esteemed organizations that have recognized and supported my talent, such as Banco de M√©xico and my current employer, Wizeline. 
I have ve also had the opportunity to contribute to important open source projects with succint contributions like the [Dow Jones' Streams Listener Client for Python](https://github.com/dowjones/dj-dna-streams-python/graphs/contributors) and [Spotify's Scio library](https://github.com/spotify/scio/issues/4938).

I love computers and find it fascinating how we‚Äôve managed to hack tiny pieces of silicon and turned them into powerful tools for human progress. One example of this was the time I implemented a simple yet useful solution to a problem during the COVID times. It was around October 2021 and the day of the generational graduation photo was approaching. We were over 300 people but due to the pandemic, we needed to take two days for the photoshoot since the school wouldn't let more than 200 people ingress the campus. I came up with the idea of using the Union-Find algorithm to inteligently split the group so people would show up in the photo with their friends on the same day. I owe you the source code for that but I was not a very different implementation from the original algorithm.

Having said that, I destinate some of my coding bandwith in these projects that focus on making life easier for myself and my loved ones. Do not expect to find things like clones of popular sites or grand displays of my programming skills; I save those for projects that help me earn a living and, unfortunately, they are proprietary code.

If you are interested, here are short briefs of two of the projects I maintain the most.
- üöø raspberry-water-measurement
  - Software that can be loaded into a Raspberry Pi so that it can read how full is a home's water tank (very usual in Mexico, my home country) to check you don't run out of water (very usual in Mexico, my home country).
  - I created an Alexa Skill so that everyone at home could ask the current water level ([Mi Tinaco](https://www.amazon.com.mx/AlanKev117-Tinaco/dp/B0BXLCRG5P))
- ‚öôÔ∏è os-config
  - It's not that I buy computers a lot, but I like to play with new installations of operating systems. This repo contains config files and scripts that help me quickly get started
  - You may find something useful in there for yourself üòâ
