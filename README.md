### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alan, and I am a computer systems engineering student. I am looking forward to learn as much as possible about the most important circuit created and improved since the last century: the computer.

I find fascinating how we've got to mimic real world behavior by using hardware, software and a lot of imagination from the greatest minds that have stepped on earth.

Since I began to study at college, I have worked in several projects. Those I really enjoy the most are about algorithms and data structures, software development and backend engineering. I am also experienced in data science projects (from cleaning datasets to creating AI models).
